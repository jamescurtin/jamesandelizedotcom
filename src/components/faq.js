                We were married in a small ceremony at the Arnold Arboretum on
                November 13, 2021. See the gallery tab for some of our favorite
                pictures from the day. We look forward to celebrating our
                marriage with you all on April 9, 2022!

            <p className={mainQuestion}>What are your Covid safety plans?</p>
            <p className={mainAnswer}>
                We are requiring everyone intending to attend to be fully
                vaccinated. We want to celebrate our wedding with as many of our
                loved ones as possible, but we also want to be as safe as
                possible. Thank you for understanding!
